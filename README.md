Most of the times it is difficult manually identify each crop and asses its growth, health. To solve this repetitive task Convolutional Neural Networks were deployed on a website, which would take an input from a farmer and classify whether a tomato plant has a given disease or not. Based on the image of the leaf, 
this model ultimately aims to detect blight in leaves of tomato plant. 

###
The trained model classifies the leaves into the following categories:
 1) Early Blight
 2) Late Blight 
 3) Healthy leave (No disease)

(friendly advice : If you wish to run the notebook, check what version of python is supported by tensorflow, and then install that version of python ! )
