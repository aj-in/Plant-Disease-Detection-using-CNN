# PlantDoc

<br/>

PlantDoc is an end-to-end website built using frameworks like ReactJS and FastAPI. A simple image of the leaf of a tomato plant is required as the user input. This website uses a trained CNN model to classify the condition of a plant. FastAPI was used to build a RESTful API which served the results of this classification to the user. The front end was developed using ReactJS.


Most of the time, it is difficult manually identify each crop and asses its growth, health. To solve this repetitive task Convolutional Neural Networks were deployed on a website, which would take an input from a farmer and classify whether a tomato plant has a given disease or not. Based on the image of the leaf, 
this model ultimately aims to detect blight in leaves of tomato plant. 

###
The trained model classifies the leaves into the following categories:
 1) Early Blight
 2) Late Blight 
 3) Healthy leave (No disease)

(friendly advice : If you wish to run the notebook, check what version of python is supported by tensorflow, and then install that version of python ! )
